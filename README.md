# Portfolio
This is the second challenge from the class
This is a simple portfolio page to showcase my work along the Bootcamp, this page includes a navigation menu that allows users to smoothly scroll to diferent section: About, Work, and Contact
How to Use:
First we have the navigation menu at the top, that allows the user to jump to the different sections of the page.
We have my project links this allows the user to see my work, right now I don't have any projects so there are no links attached yet.
And lastly we have a responsive and device friendly design, the user can access this portfolio from any device, like desktop computer, laptop, tablets and mobile phone.
